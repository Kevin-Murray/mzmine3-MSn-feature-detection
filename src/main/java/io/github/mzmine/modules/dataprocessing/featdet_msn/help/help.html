        <h1>MSn feature list builder</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The MSn feature list builder modules scans the raw data looking for MSn scans and builds a
            chromatographic feature for each MS1 precursor ion with a corresponding MSn scan.
        </p><p>
            Using the <i>MS Level</i> parameter input in the <i>Scan Selection</i> field, the specified MSn scans
            are subset and the precursor MZ is collected for each scan. The precursor MZ value is
            obtained from the corresponding MS2 scan. If the MS Level is greater than 2, the original
            isolating MZ the MSn scans corresponding MS2 is used as the precursor MZ. The retention time
            of the scan and precursor MZ are used to build a feature chromatogram for each detected
            MSn scan.
        </p><p>
            A feature list of precursor signals is constructed using the specified <i>mass and
            retention time tolerances</i>. For each detected MSn-containing precursor signal, a feature chromatogram
            in the retention time range is built using all MS1 basepeaks within the mass range. 
        </p><p>
            If more than one peak is detected in the range or more precise peak integration
            is required, the feature list may be deconvoluted via the <b>Chromatogram resolving</b> tools.
            If more than one MSn scan triggered on the same precursor ion, duplicate feature chromatograms
            may be built. Use the <b>Feature list filtering</b> > <b>Duplicate feature filter</b> tool to
            remove redundant results from the generated feature list.
        </p><p>
            Note - MSn files may not be correctly detected if Raw data files were converted using
            older versions of MSConvert or ThermoRawFileParserer. If no MSn scans are detected in
            the dataset, re-convert the using the latest version of these tools to avoid complications.
        </p>
